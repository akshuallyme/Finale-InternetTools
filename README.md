Download or clone the entire project folder to your computer.

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate into the backend folder:
cd backend

Install all required dependencies by running:
npm install

Start the server using:
node server.js or run npm start

Once the server is running, a link to the application will be generated automatically in the terminal (usually http://localhost:3000
). Open this link in your web browser to use the project immediately.

Then you can use the project as I've demonstrated in the video.

Thank you so much for your time, sir.
